# Publishing Vihaan's invitation

1. Fill in `event-config.js` with the confirmed date, start time, and WhatsApp number. The date and time are in Mauritius, UTC+04:00. The number must include the country code, using digits only.
2. Run `npm run check:ready`. It reports any missing or invalid event details.
3. Run `npm test` and `npm run build`.
4. Publish the **contents of `dist/`** using HTTPS.

## GitHub Pages

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository, including `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`. The workflow uses `main`; edit its branch filter if your default branch has a different name.
2. In **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Open **Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**, or push a commit to `main`.
4. Open the URL shown by the completed deployment, typically `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/`.

The workflow installs dependencies, runs source checks, builds, and uploads only `dist/`. Do not select branch-based publishing of the source directory. Relative URLs support repository sites, account sites, and custom domains without entering a repository name in the configuration.

Event details can remain pending for a preview deployment. Before sharing, fill in `event-config.js` and run `npm run check:ready`; missing details do not block deployment.

GitHub Pages does not apply the Netlify-style `public/_headers` file or `vercel.json`. HTML content-security policies and iframe sandbox restrictions still apply, but additional custom HTTP headers (including `frame-ancestors`) require a host that supports them.

For a local production check, run `npm run build` then `npm run test:pages`. This checks both the domain root and a repository subpath using a static server without an SPA fallback. It requires installed Chrome (or `CHROME_PATH`). The workflow itself runs `npm test` and the build.

## Netlify or Cloudflare Pages

For a repository deployment, use build command `npm run build` and output directory `dist`. For a manual Netlify deployment, upload `dist/` or the extracted hosting ZIP. Keep `_headers` in the upload: it provides the security headers.

## Vercel

Deploy the project repository. The root `vercel.json` specifies the build output and security headers. Do not copy that configuration into `dist/`, because it describes the source-project build.

## Other hosting

Publish `dist/` and translate `public/_headers` into your host's HTTP-header configuration. The HTML also carries content-security policies. The frame-ancestor rule must be supplied as an HTTP header. Confirm the configured headers using your browser's Network panel after publication.

This build uses relative paths and supports a domain root or a nested folder such as `/birthday/`. Use the folder URL with its trailing slash (static hosts normally redirect to it).

## Hosting ZIP

After rebuilding, run `python3 scripts/package-site.py` to update `vihaan-invitation.zip`. Only public production files are packaged; dependencies, project source, reference artwork, and local test results are excluded. Complete source archives for the open-source games remain included for license compliance.

The current event details are incomplete. You can preview the website, but the calendar and directed WhatsApp RSVP become available only after the corresponding settings are filled in and the site is rebuilt.

## Final live check

Open the HTTPS site on your phone. Check the displayed date and time, open each game, open Maps, and confirm that the RSVP button prepares a message to your intended WhatsApp recipient. The site never sends the message itself. Website event details and the RSVP recipient are public; use your host's access controls if you need a private invitation.

## Shared leaderboards

Follow `LEADERBOARDS.md` to create the Supabase tables/functions and fill in `leaderboard-config.js`. GitHub Pages continues hosting the static invitation; Supabase stores the shared results. Run the database setup before deploying a configured frontend.
